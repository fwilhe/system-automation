System Automation powered by Ansible™

Currently, only fedora is supported.

== Project Layout

* `playbooks/common.yml`: Setup for a (in my personal view) minimal system. Does not require an X server.
* `playbooks/desktop.yml`: Setup for desktop computers.

== Setup

Make sure that `python-dnf` is installed.

.Run `common` playbook
----
ansible-playbook -K -i inventory fedora.yml
----

.Run `desktop` playbook
----
ansible-playbook -K -v -i inventory playbooks/desktop.yml
----

== Testing

Vagrant can be used to test this project.
This does not include the `desktop` playbook.

.Fire up Vagrant VM with Ansible Provisioning
----
vagrant up
----

.Provision running VM
----
vagrant provision
----
